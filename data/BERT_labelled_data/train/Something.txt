Something in the way she woos me.%joy
I don't want to leave her now.%fear
You know I believe and how.%joy
Somewhere in her smile she knows, That I don't need no other lover.%joy
Something in her style that shows me.%joy
I don't want to leave her now.%joy
You know I believe and how.%joy
You're asking me will my love grow.%surprise
I don't know, I don't know.%fear
You stick around, now it may show.%joy
I don't know, I don't know.%fear
Something in the way she knows, And all I have to do is think of her.%joy
Something in the things she shows me.%joy
I don't want to leave her now.%joy
You know I believe and how.%joy

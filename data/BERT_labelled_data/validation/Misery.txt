John:Paul
The world is treating me bad, misery.%sadness
I'm the kind of guy who never used to cry.%surprise
The world is treating me bad, misery.%sadness
I've lost her now for sure, I won't see her no more.%sadness
It's gonna be a drag, misery.%fear
I'll remember all the little things we've done.%sadness
Can't she see she'll always be the only one?%joy
Only one.%joy
Send her back to me, 'cause everyone can see, without her I will be in misery.%fear
I'll remember all the little things we've done.%sadness
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one.%sadness
Lonely one.%sadness
Send her back to me, 'cause everyone can see, without her I will be in misery.%fear
In misery, my misery, misery.%fear

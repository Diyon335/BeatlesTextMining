Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park, shaves in the dark trying to save paper.
 Sleeps in a hole in the road, saving up to buy some clothes.
 Keeps a ten-bob note up Mean Mr. Mustard nose.
 Such a mean old man.
 Such a mean old man.
 Mean Mr. Mustard sister Pam works in a shop, His sister Pam never stops, His sister Pam's a go-getter.
 Takes Mean Mr. Mustard out to look at the Queen.
 Only place that Mean Mr. Mustard's ever been.
 Always shouts out something obscene.
 Such a dirty old man.
 Dirty old man.

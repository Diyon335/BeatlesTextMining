He's a real nowhere man sitting in his nowhere land making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
 Doesn't have a point of view, knows not where he's going to, isn't he a bit like you and me?
 Nowhere man, please listen (aaah-ah-la-la-la) you don't know what you're missing (aaah-ah-la-la-la).
 Nowhere man (aaah-ah-la-la-la), the world is at your command (aaah-aah-lala-lala).
 He's as blind as he can be, just sees what he wants to see.
 Nowhere man, can you see me at all?
 Nowhere man, don't worry (aaah-ah-la-la-la), take your time; don't hurry (aaah-ah-la-la-la).
 Leave it all (aaah-ah-la-la-la) till somebody else lends you a hand (aaah-aah-lala-lala).

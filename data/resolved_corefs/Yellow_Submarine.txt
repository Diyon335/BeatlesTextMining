In the town where I was born, lived a man who sailed to sea, and a man who sailed to sea told We all of a man who sailed to sea life in the land of submarines.
 So We all sailed on to the sun, till We all found a sea of green, and We all lived beneath the waves in We all yellow submarine.
 We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 And We all friends are all aboard, many more of them live next door, and the band begins to play.
 We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 Full steam ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full steam ahead.
 Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant.
 Cut the cable!
 Drop the cable!
 Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye.
 Captain, captain.
 As We all live a life of ease (a life of ease), every one of We all (every one of We all) has all We all need (has all We all need).
 Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green) in We all yellow (in We all yellow) submarine (submarine, ha-ha!).
 We all live in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 We all live in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

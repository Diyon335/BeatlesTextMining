For the benefit of Mr. Kite, there will be a show tonight on trampoline.
 The Hendersons will all be there, late of Pablo Fanque's fair, what a scene.
 Over men and horses, hoops and garters, lastly through a hogshead of real fire.
 In this way, Mr. K. will challenge the world.
 The celebrated Mr. K. performs Mr. Kite feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate.
 The Hendersons will dance and sing as Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late.
 Messrs. K. and H. assure the public Messrs. K. and H. production will be second to none.
 And of course, Henry the Horse dances the waltz.
 The band begins at ten to six when Mr. K. performs Mr. Kite tricks without a sound.
 And Mr. H. will demonstrate ten somersets Mr. H.'ll undertake on solid ground.
 Having been some days in preparation, a splendid time is guaranteed for all.
 And tonight, Mr. Kite is topping the bill.

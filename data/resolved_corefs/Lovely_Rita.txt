Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh.
 Lovely Rita, meter maid.
 Lovely Rita, meter maid.
 Lovely Rita, meter maid.
 Nothing can come between us.
 When the bill gets dark I tow your heart away.
 Standing by a parking meter.
 When I caught a glimpse of Rita.
 Filling in the ticket in Rita little white book.
 In a cap Rita looked much older.
 And the bag across Rita shoulder.
 Made Rita look a little like a military man.
 Lovely Rita, meter maid.
 May I inquire discreetly.
 When are Rita free to take some tea with me?
 Rita.
 Took Rita out and tried to win Rita.
 Had a laugh and over dinner.
 Told Rita I would really like to see Rita again.
 Got the bill and Rita paid the bill.
 Took Rita home and nearly made the bill.
 Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two.
 Oh lovely Rita, meter maid.
 Where would I be without Rita?
 Give us a wink and make me think of Rita.
 Lovely Rita, meter maid.
 They'll never believe the bill.

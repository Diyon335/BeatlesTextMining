Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh.
 Lovely Rthe billa, meter maid.
 Lovely Rthe billa, meter maid.
 Lovely Rthe billa, meter maid.
 Nothing can come between us.
 When the bill gets dark I tow your heart away.
 Standing by a parking meter.
 When I caught a glimpse of Rthe billa.
 Filling in the ticket in her lthe billtle whthe bille book.
 In a cap she looked much older.
 And the bag across her shoulder.
 Made her look a lthe billtle like a milthe billary man.
 Lovely Rthe billa, meter maid.
 May I inquire discreetly.
 When are you free to take some tea wthe billh me?
 Rthe billa.
 Took her out and tried to win her.
 Had a laugh and over dinner.
 Told her I would really like to see her again.
 Got the bill and Rthe billa paid the bill.
 Took her home and nearly made the bill.
 Sthe billting on a sofa wthe billh a sister or two.
 Oh lovely Rthe billa, meter maid.
 Where would I be wthe billhout you?
 Give us a wink and make me think of you.
 Lovely Rthe billa, meter maid.
 They'll never believe the bill.

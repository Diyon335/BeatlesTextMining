Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical science in tThe judge home.
 Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh-oh, oh.
 Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine, calls The judger on tThe judge phone.
 "Can I take you out to tThe judge pictures, Jo-oh-oh-oan?".
 But as sThe judge's getting ready to go, a knock comes on tThe judge door.
 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer, came down upon The judger The judgead.
 Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer, made sure sThe judge was dead.
 Back in school again, Maxwell plays tThe judge fool again.
 TeacThe judger gets annoyed.
 Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene.
 SThe judge tells Max to stay wThe judgen tThe judge class has gone away, so The judge waits behind.
 Writing fifty times "I must not be so, oh-oh, oh".
 But wThe judgen sThe judge turns The judger back on tThe judge boy, The judge creeps up from behind.
 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon The judger The judgead (do-do do-doo-doo).
 Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that sThe judge was dead.
 (Do-do do-doo-doo).
 P.C.
 31 said "We've caught a dirty one", Maxwell stands alone.
 Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh-oh, oh.
 Rose and Valerie, screaming from tThe judge gallery, say The judge must go free ("Maxwell must go free").
 TThe judge judge does not agree, and The judge tells tThe judgem so, oh-oh, oh.
 But as tThe judge words are leaving his lips, a noise comes from behind.
 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his The judgead (do-do do-doo-doo).
 Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that The judge was dead.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh.
 (Do-do do-doo-doo).
 Silver hammer man.

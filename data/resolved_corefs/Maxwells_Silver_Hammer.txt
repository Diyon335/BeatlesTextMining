Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical science in the home.
 Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh-oh, oh.
 Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine, calls Joan on the phone.
 "Can Maxwell's take Joan out to the pictures, Jo-oh-oh-oan?".
 But as Joan's getting ready to go, a knock comes on the door.
 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer, came down upon Joan head.
 Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer, made sure Joan was dead.
 Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again.
 Teacher gets annoyed.
 Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene.
 She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away, so Maxwell's waits behind.
 Writing fifty times "Maxwell's must not be so, oh-oh, oh".
 But when Joan turns Joan back on the boy, Maxwell's creeps up from behind.
 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon Joan head (do-do do-doo-doo).
 Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that Joan was dead.
 (Do-do do-doo-doo).
 P.C.
 31 said "We've caught a dirty one", Maxwell stands alone.
 Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh-oh, oh.
 Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery, say Maxwell's must go free ("Maxwell must go free").
 The judge does not agree, and Maxwell's tells Rose and Valerie so, oh-oh, oh.
 But as the words are leaving Maxwell's lips, a noise comes from behind.
 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon Maxwell's head (do-do do-doo-doo).
 Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that Maxwell's was dead.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh.
 (Do-do do-doo-doo).
 Silver hammer man.

Martha, my dear.
 Though I spend my days in conversation, please remember me.
 Martha, my love, don't forget me, Martha, my dear.
 Hold Martha, my dear head up, Martha, my dear silly girl.
 Look what Martha, my dear've done.
 When Martha, my dear find Martha, my dear in the thick of it, help Martha, my dear to a bit of what is all around Martha, my dear.
 Silly girl.
 Take a good look around Martha, my dear.
 Take a good look; Martha, my dear're bound to see that Martha, my dear and me were meant to be for each other.
 Silly girl.
 Hold Martha, my dear hand out, Martha, my dear silly girl.
 See what Martha, my dear've done.
 When Martha, my dear find Martha, my dear in the thick of it, help Martha, my dear to a bit of what is all around Martha, my dear.
 Silly girl.
 Martha, my dear, Martha, my dear have always been my inspiration, please be good to be.
 Martha, my love, don't forget me, Martha, my dear.

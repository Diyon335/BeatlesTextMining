In Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
 And all the people that come and go stop and say hello.
 On the corner is a banker with a motorcar.
 The little children laugh at the banker behind the banker back, and the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain.
 Very strange.
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, there beneath the blue suburban skies.
 I sit and meanwhile back.
 In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hourglass, and in the banker pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
 the fireman likes to keep the banker fire engine clean.
 his fire engine's a clean machine.
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, four of fish and finger pies in summer.
 Meanwhile back.
 Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout, a pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
 And though a pretty nurse feels as if a pretty nurse's in a play, a pretty nurse is anyway.
 In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer.
 We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim, and then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain.
 Very strange.
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, there beneath the blue suburban skies.
 I sit and meanwhile back.
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, there beneath the blue suburban skies.
 Penny Lane.

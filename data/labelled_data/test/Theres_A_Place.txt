John:Paul
There is a place where I can go when I feel low, when I feel blue, and it's my mind.%sadness
And there's no time when I'm alone.%sadness
I think of you and things you do, go 'round my head, the things you said, like "I love only you."%joy
In my mind, there's no sorrow.%joy
Don't you know that it's so?%joy
There'll be no sad tomorrow.%joy
Don't you know that it's so?%joy
There is a place where I can go when I feel low, when I feel blue, and it's my mind.%sadness
And there's no time when I'm alone.%sadness
There's a place.%joy

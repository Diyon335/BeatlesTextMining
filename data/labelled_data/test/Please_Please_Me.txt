Last night I said these words to my girl, I know you never even try, girl.%sadness
Come on, come on, come on, come on.%sadness
Please please me, whoa, yeah, like I please you.%sadness
You don't need me to show the way, love.%sadness
Why do I always have to say "love"?%sadness
Come on, come on, come on, come on.%sadness
Please please me, whoa, yeah, like I please you.%sadness
I don't wanna sound complaining, but you know there's always rain in my heart.%sadness
I do all the pleasing with you, it's so hard to reason with you, whoa yeah.%sadness
Why do you make me blue?%sadness
Last night I said these words to my girl, I know you never even try, girl.%sadness
Come on, come on, come on, come on.%sadness
Please please me, whoa, yeah, like I please you.%sadness
Please me, whoa, yeah, like I please you.%sadness
Please me, whoa, yeah, like I please you.%sadness

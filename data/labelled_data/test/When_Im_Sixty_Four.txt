When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now, will you still be sending me a Valentine?%fear
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?%fear
If I'd been out till quarter to three, would you lock the door?%fear
Will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm sixty-four?%fear
You'll be older too, and if you say the word, I could stay with you.%love
I could be handy mending a fuse when your lights have gone.%love
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, Sunday mornings, go for a ride.%joy
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?%joy
Will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm sixty-four?%fear
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear.%joy
We shall scrimp and save (we shall scrimp and save), grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave.%joy
Send me a postcard, drop me a line, stating point of view.%joy
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away.%sadness
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forevermore.%love
Will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm sixty-four?%fear

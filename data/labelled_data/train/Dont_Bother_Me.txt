Since she's been gone, I want no one to talk to me.%sadness
It's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see.%sadness
So go away, leave me alone.%sadness
Don't bother me.%anger
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own.%surprise
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone.%anger
I've got no time for you right now.%anger
Don't bother me.%anger
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.%sadness
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.%love
But till she's here, please don't come near, just stay away.%anger
I'll let you know when she's come home, until that day.%fear
Don't come around, leave me alone.%anger
Don't bother me.%anger
I've got no time for you right now.%anger

But till she's here, please don't come near, just stay away.%anger

Don't bother me.%anger

I've got every reason on earth to be mad 'Cause I just lost the only girl I had.%anger
If I could get my way I'd get myself locked up today But I can't, so I'll cry instead.%sadness
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet.%anger
I can't talk to people that I meet.%anger
If I could see you now I'd try to make you sad somehow But I can't, so I'll cry instead.%sadness
Don't want to cry when there's people there.%fear
I get shy when they start to stare.%fear
I'm gonna hide myself away But I'll come back again someday.%sadness
And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls.%anger
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world.%anger
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two And show you what your loving man can do.%joy
Until then, I'll cry instead.%sadness
Don't want to cry when there's people there.%fear
I get shy when they start to stare.%fear
I'm gonna hide myself away But I'll come back again someday.%sadness
And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls.%joy
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world.%anger
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two And show you what your loving man can do.%joy
Until then, I'll cry instead.%sadness

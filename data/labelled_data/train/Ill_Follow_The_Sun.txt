One day you'll look to see I've gone.%sadness
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.%joy
Some day you'll know I was the one.%sadness
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.%joy
And now the time has come, and so, my love, I must go.%sadness
And though I lose a friend, in the end you will know, oh.%sadness
One day you'll find that I have gone.%sadness
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.%joy
Yeah, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.%joy
And now the time has come, and so, my love, I must go.%sadness
And though I lose a friend, in the end you will know, oh.%sadness
One day you'll find that I have gone.%sadness
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.%joy

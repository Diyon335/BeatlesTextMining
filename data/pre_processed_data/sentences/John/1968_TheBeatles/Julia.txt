Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it just to reach you, Julia.
Julia, Julia, Oceanchild calls me, so I sing the song of love, Julia.
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile calls me, so I sing the song of love, Julia.
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering in the sun.
Julia, Julia, morning moon touch me, so I sing the song of love, Julia.
When I cannot sing my heart, I can only speak my mind, Julia.
Julia, Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me, so I sing a song of love, Julia.
Mm, calls me, so I sing the song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia.

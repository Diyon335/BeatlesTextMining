Well, she was just seventeen.
If you know what I mean, and the way she looked was way beyond compare.
So how could I dance with another when I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see that before too long I'd fall in love with her.
She wouldn't dance with another when I saw her standing there.
Well, my heart went boom when I crossed that room, and I held her hand in mine.
Whoa, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight, and before too long I fell in love with her.
Now, I'll never dance with another when I saw her standing there.
Well, my heart went boom when I crossed that room, and I held her hand in mine.
Oh, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight, and before too long I fell in love with her.
Now, I'll never dance with another since I saw her standing there.
Whoa, since I saw her standing there, yeah, well, since I saw her standing there.

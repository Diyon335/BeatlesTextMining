Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool, and he never gives an answer.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down, and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
Well on the way, head in a cloud, the man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud.
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make, and he never seems to notice.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down, and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do, and he never shows his feelings.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down, and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh-oh-oh, round and round and round and round and round.
He never listens to them, he knows that they're the fool, they don't like him.
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down, and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
Ohhhh, round and round and round and round and ohhhh.

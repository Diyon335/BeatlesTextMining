Martha, my dear.
Though I spend my days in conversation, please remember me.
Martha, my love, don't forget me, Martha, my dear.
Hold your head up, you silly girl.
Look what you've done.
When you find yourself in the thick of it, help yourself to a bit of what is all around you.
Silly girl.
Take a good look around you.
Take a good look; you're bound to see that you and me were meant to be for each other.
Silly girl.
Hold your hand out, you silly girl.
See what you've done.
When you find yourself in the thick of it, help yourself to a bit of what is all around you.
Silly girl.
Martha, my dear, you have always been my inspiration, please be good to be.
Martha, my love, don't forget me, Martha, my dear.

In the town where I was born, lived a man who sailed to sea, and he told us of his life in the land of submarines.
So we sailed on to the sun, till we found a sea of green, and we lived beneath the waves in our yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
And our friends are all aboard, many more of them live next door, and the band begins to play.
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
Full steam ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full steam ahead.
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant.
Cut the cable!
Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye.
Captain, captain.
As we live a life of ease (a life of ease), every one of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need).
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green) in our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ha-ha!).
We all live in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

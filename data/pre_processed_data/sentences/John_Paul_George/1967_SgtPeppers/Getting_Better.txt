It's getting better all the time.
I used to get mad at my school, but now I can't complain.
The teachers that taught me weren't cool, but I can't complain.
You're holding me down, turning me 'round, filling me up with your rules.
I've got to admit it's getting better, a little better all the time.
I have to admit it's getting better, it's getting better since you've been mine.
I used to be an angry young man, hiding my head in the sand.
But you gave me the word, I finally heard, I'm doing the best that I can.
I've got to admit it's getting better, a little better all the time.
I have to admit it's getting better, it's getting better since you've been mine.
It's getting so much better all the time.
I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved.
Man, I was mean, but I'm changing my scene, and I'm doing the best that I can.
I admit it's getting better, a little better all the time.
Yes, I admit it's getting better, it's getting better since you've been mine.
Getting so much better all the time.
It's getting better all the time.

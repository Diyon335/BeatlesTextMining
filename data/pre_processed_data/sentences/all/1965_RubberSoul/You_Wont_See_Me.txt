When I call you up, your line's engaged.
I have had enough, so act your age.
We have lost the time that was so hard to find.
And I will lose my mind if you won't see me (You won't see me).
You won't see me (You won't see me).
I don't know why you (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
Should want to hide (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
But I can't get through (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
My hands are tied (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
I won't want to stay (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
I don't have much to say (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
But I'd get turned away (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
And you won't see me (You won't see me).
You won't see me (You won't see me).
Time after time, you refuse to even listen.
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing (No, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't).
Though the days are few (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
They're filled with tears (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
And since I lost you (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
It feels like years (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
Yes, it seems so long (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
Girl, since you've been gone (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
And I just can't go on (Ooh-ooh) (La la-la).
If you won't see me (You won't see me).
You won't see me (You won't see me).

Hey!
Ah-ah!
Yeah, yeah!
Woah, woah.
(Ooh-ooh la la-la).
(Ooh-ooh la la-la).
(Ooh-ooh la la-la).

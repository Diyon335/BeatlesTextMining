I want to tell you that my head is filled with things to say, but when you're here, all those words seem to slip away.
When I get near you, the games begin to drag me down, but it's alright.
I'll make you maybe next time around.
But if I seem to act unkind, please understand it's only me.
It's not my mind that is confusing things.
I want to tell you that I feel hung up, but I don't know why.
I don't mind, I could wait forever because I've got time.
Sometimes I wish I knew you well, then I could speak my mind and tell you.
Maybe you'd understand.
I want to tell you that I feel hung up and I don't know why, but I don't mind.
I could wait forever because I've got time.
I've got time.

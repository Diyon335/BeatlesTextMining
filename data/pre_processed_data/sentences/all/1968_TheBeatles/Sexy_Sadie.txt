Sexy Sadie, what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone.
You broke the rules, laid it down for all to see.
One sunny day, the world was waiting for a lover, and you came along to turn on everyone.
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all.
How did you know the world was waiting just for you?
You'll get yours yet, however big you think you are.
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table.
Just a smile would lighten everything.
She's the latest and the greatest of them all.
But in the end, she made a fool of everyone.
However big you think you are, Sexy Sadie.

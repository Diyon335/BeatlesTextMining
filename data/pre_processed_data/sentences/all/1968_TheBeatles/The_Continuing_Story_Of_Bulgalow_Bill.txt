Hey, Bungalow Bill, what did you kill?
You went out tiger hunting with your elephant and gun, always accompanied by your mom.
You're the all-American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son.
The children sing and ask you what you killed.
Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies, Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise.
Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes.
The children sing and inquire about what you killed.
The children question if killing is a sin, but your mom defends your actions, saying that the tiger looked fierce and if looks could kill, it would have been you instead of him.
The children continue to sing and ask you what you killed.
So, hey, Bungalow Bill, what did you kill?
The song ends with a repeated chorus of questioning what you killed, leaving the answer up to interpretation.

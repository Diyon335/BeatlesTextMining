Anna, you come and ask me, girl, to set you free, girl.
You say he loves you more than me, so I will set you free.
Go with him, go with him.
All of my life, I've been searching for a girl to love me like I love you.
But every girl I've ever had breaks my heart and leaves me sad.
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
Anna, just one more thing, girl, you give back your ring to me And I will set you free.
Go with him.

A taste of honey, tasting much sweeter than wine.
Doo doo n'doo, doo doo n'doo.
I dream of your first kiss, and then I feel it upon my lips again.
A taste of honey, tasting much sweeter than wine.
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return.
I'll come back for the honey and you.
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart.
There lingers still, though we're far apart.
That taste of honey, tasting much sweeter than wine.
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return.
I'll come back for the honey and you.

I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.
And it's true that it really only goes to show that I know that I should never, never, never be blue.
Now you're mine.
My happiness, dear, makes me cry, And in time, you'll understand the reason why.
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad, But you're the only love that I've ever had.
I can't believe it's happened to me.
I can't conceive of any more misery.
Ask me why, I'll say I love you, And I'm always thinking of you.

You, you.

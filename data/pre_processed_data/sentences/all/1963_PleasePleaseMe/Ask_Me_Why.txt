I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.%joy
And it's true that it really only goes to show that I know that I should never, never, never be blue.%joy
Now you're mine.%joy
My happiness, dear, makes me cry, And in time, you'll understand the reason why.%joy
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad, But you're the only love that I've ever had.%joy
I can't believe it's happened to me.%joy
I can't conceive of any more misery.%joy
Ask me why, I'll say I love you, And I'm always thinking of you.%joy

You, you.%joy

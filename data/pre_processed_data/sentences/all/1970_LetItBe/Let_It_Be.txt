When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.%anger
And in my hour of darkness Mother Mary is standing right in front of me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.%anger
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.%anger
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.%anger
And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree There will be an answer, let it be.%anger
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see.%anger
There will be an answer, let it be.%anger
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.%anger
There will be an answer, let it be.%anger
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.%anger
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.%anger
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.%anger
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be, be.%anger
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me.%anger
Shinin' until tomorrow, let it be.%anger
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me.%anger
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.%anger
And let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.%anger
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.%anger
And let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.%anger
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.%anger

If you're listening to this song, you may think the chords are going wrong, but they're not. He just wrote it like that. When you're listening late at night, you may think the band are not quite right, but they are. They just play it like that. It doesn't really matter what chords I play, what words I say or time of day it is, as it's only a northern song. It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear or how I fare or if my hair is brown when/as it's only a northern song. If you think the harmony is a little dark and out of key, you're correct. There's nobody there, and I told you there's no-one there.

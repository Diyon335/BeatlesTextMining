John:Paul
There is a place where I can go when I feel low, when I feel blue, and it's my mind. And there's no time when I'm alone.
I think of you and things you do, go 'round my head, the things you said, like "I love only you."
In my mind, there's no sorrow. Don't you know that it's so? There'll be no sad tomorrow. Don't you know that it's so?
There is a place where I can go when I feel low, when I feel blue, and it's my mind. And there's no time when I'm alone.
There's a place.

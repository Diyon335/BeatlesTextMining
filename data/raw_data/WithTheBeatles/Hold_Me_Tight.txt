John:Paul
It feels so right now, hold me tight. Tell me I'm the only one, and then I might never be the lonely one.
So hold me tight tonight, tonight, tonight. It's you, you, you.
Hold me tight, let me go on loving you. Tonight, tonight, making love to only you.
So hold me tight tonight, tonight, tonight. It's you, you, you.
Don't know what it means to hold you tight, being here alone tonight with you.
It feels so right now, hold me tight. Tell me I'm the only one, and then I might never be the lonely one.
So hold me tight tonight, tonight, tonight. It's you, you, you.
Don't know what it means to hold you tight, being here alone tonight with you.
It feels so right now, hold me tight. Let me go on loving you. Tonight, tonight, making love to only you.
So hold me tight tonight, tonight, tonight. It's you, you, you.

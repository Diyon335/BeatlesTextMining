Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt? And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse, always having dirt to play around in. Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts? You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt, always having clean shirts to play around in. In their sties with all their backing, they don't care what goes on around. In their eyes, there's something lacking, what they need's a damn good whacking. Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives. You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives, clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon. One more time.

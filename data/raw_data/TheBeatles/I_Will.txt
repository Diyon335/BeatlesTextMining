Paul
Who knows how long I've loved you? You know I love you still. Will I wait a lonely lifetime? If you want me to, I will.
For if I ever saw you, I didn't catch your name. But it never really mattered, I will always feel the same.
Love you forever and forever, love you with all my heart. Love you whenever we're together, love you when we're apart.
And when at last I find you, your song will fill the air. Sing it loud so I can hear you, make it easy to be near you. For the things you do endear you to me. Oh, you know I will. I will.
Mm, da-da-da-da-da-da da.

John
When I wake up early in the morning, I lift my head and I'm still yawning. Even in the middle of a dream, I prefer to stay in bed and float upstream, lost in my own thoughts.
Please don't wake me, don't shake me. Just leave me where I am. I'm only sleeping.
Some may think I'm lazy, but I don't mind. I believe they're the ones who are crazy, constantly rushing around with unnecessary speed until they realize there's no real need for it.
Please don't spoil my day, I'm in my own world, miles away. And after all, I'm only sleeping.
I keep an eye on the world passing by my window, taking my time. I lie there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for that sleepy feeling to fully take over.

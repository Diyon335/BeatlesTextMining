Paul
To lead a better life, I need my love to be here. Here, making each day of the year, changing my life with a wave of her hand. Nobody can deny that there's something there.
There, running my hands through her hair, both of us thinking how good it can be. Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there.
I want her everywhere, and if she's beside me, I know I need never care. But to love her is to need her.
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share, each one believing that love never dies. Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there.

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share, each one believing that love never dies. Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there.
I will be there and everywhere, here, there, and everywhere.

George
Each day seems to go by so quickly, I barely have time to catch my breath. Time slips away, and before I know it, it's already in the past. There's no time to put a sign on me, to mark my presence or proclaim who I am. So, love me while you still can, before I become an old man, no longer alive.
A lifetime is incredibly short, and you can't buy yourself a new one. But what you have right now means so much to me. Let's make love all day long, expressing our love through singing songs.
Let's make love all day long, immersing ourselves in passion and melody.
There are people out there who will try to bring you down, who will take advantage of you. They'll try to bury you under their own flaws and wrongdoings. But I promise, I'll make love to you if that's what you desire. I'll be there for you, offering my love and support.

It won't be long, yeah yeah yeah yeah. It won't be long, yeah yeah yeah yeah. It won't be long, yeah, 'til I belong to you, ahh.
Every night, when everybody has fun, here am I, sitting all on my own.
It won't be long, yeah yeah yeah yeah. It won't be long, yeah yeah yeah yeah. It won't be long, yeah, 'til I belong to you, ahh.
Since you left me (you left me here on my own), I'm so alone. Now you're coming, you're coming on home (now you're coming on home). I'll be good like I know I should (yes, you're coming on home). You're coming home, you're coming home.
Every night, the tears come down from my eye. Every day, I've done nothing but cry.
It won't be long, yeah yeah yeah yeah. It won't be long, yeah yeah yeah yeah. It won't be long, yeah, 'til I belong to you, ahh.
Well, since you left me (you left me here on my own), I'm so alone. Now you're coming, you're coming on home (now you're coming on home). I'll be good like I know I should (yes, you're coming on home). You're coming home, you're coming home.
So every day, we'll be happy, I know. Now I know that you won't leave me no more.
It won't be long, yeah yeah yeah yeah. It won't be long, yeah yeah yeah yeah. It won't be long, yeah, 'til I belong to you.

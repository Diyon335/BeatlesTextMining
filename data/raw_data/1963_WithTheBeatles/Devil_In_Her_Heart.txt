She's got the devil in her heart, but her eyes they tantalize. She's gonna tear your heart apart, oh, her lips, they really thrill me.
I'll take my chances, for romance is so important to me. She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me, she's an angel sent to me.
She's got the devil in her heart, no, no, this I can't believe. She's gonna tear your heart apart, no, no, nay will she deceive.
I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go, not when she hugs me and says she loves me so. She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me, listen, can't you see?
She's got the devil in her heart, oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe. She's gonna tear your heart apart, no, no, nay will she deceive.

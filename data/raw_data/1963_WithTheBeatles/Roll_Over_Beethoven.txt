We're gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local DJ. It's a rockin' little record, I want my jockey to play. Roll over, Beethoven, gotta hit it again today.
You know, my temperature's risin' and the jukebox blown a fuse. My heart beatin' rhythm and my soul keeps a-singing the blues. Roll over, Beethoven, and tell Tchaikovsky the news.
I got a rockin' pneumonia, I need a shot of rhythm and blues. I think I caught it off the writer, sittin' down by the rhythm revues. Roll over, Beethoven, rockin' in two by two.
Well, if you feel it and like it, well, get your lover and reel and rock it. Roll it over and move on up just a trifle further and a-reel and rock it. Roll it over, roll over, Beethoven, a-rockin' in two by two.
Well, early in the mornin', I'm a givin' you the warnin'. Don't you step on my blue suede shoes. Hey, diddle, diddle, I'm a-playin' my fiddle, ain't got nothing to lose. Roll over, Beethoven, and tell Tchaikovsky the news.
You know she winks like a glow worm, dives like a spinnin' top. She's got a crazy partner, oughta see him reel an' rock. 'S long as she got a dime, the music will never stop.
Well, roll over, Beethoven. Yeah, roll over, Beethoven. Roll over, Beethoven. Oh, roll over, Beethoven. Roll over, Beethoven. Dig to these rhythm and blues.

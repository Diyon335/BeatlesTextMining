Paul
Let's all get up and dance to a song that was a hit before your mother was born. Though she was born a long, long time ago, your mother should know. Your mother should know.
Sing it again.

Lift up your hearts and sing me a song that was a hit before your mother was born. Though she was born a long, long time ago, your mother should know. Your mother should know. Your mother should know. Your mother should know.
Sing it again.
Daa-da da-daa da-daa-daa-da-da
Da-daa-da daa da-daa daa daa-da-da-daa
Though she was born a long, long time ago, your mother should know. Your mother should know. Your mother should know. Your mother should know. Your mother should know. Your mother should know.

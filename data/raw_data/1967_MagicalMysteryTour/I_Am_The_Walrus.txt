I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together. See how they run like pigs from a gun. See how they fly. I'm crying.
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come. Corporation T-shirt. Stupid bloody Tuesday. Man, you've been a naughty boy. You let your face grow long.
I am the Eggman (whoo!). They are the Eggmen (whoo!). I am the Walrus. Goo goo g'joob.
Mister city policeman sitting. Pretty little policemen in a row. See how they fly like Lucy in the sky. See how they run. I'm crying. I'm cry-'-ng (Ahhh!). I'm crying. I'm cry-'- (whoooo!).
Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye. Crabalocker fishwife. Pornographic priestess. Boy, you've been a naughty girl. You let your knickers down.
I am the Eggman. They are the Eggmen. I am the Walrus. Goo goo g'joob.
Sitting in an English garden, waiting for the sun. If the sun don't come, you get a tan from standing in the English rain.
I am the Eggman (Now, good sir...). They are the Eggmen (... poor man, made tame to fortune's...). I am the Walrus. Goo goo g'joob goo goo g'joob.
Expert texpert, choking smokers. Don't you think the joker laughs at you? (Ho-ho-ho! Hee-hee-hee! Ha-ha-ha!). See how they smile like pigs in a sty. See how they schnied. I'm crying.
Semolina Pilchard climbing up the Eiffel Tower. Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna. Man, you should've seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe.
I am the Eggman (whoo!). They are the Eggmen (whoo!). I am the Walrus (whoo!). Goo goo g'joob, goo goo g'joob. Goo goo g'joob, goo goo g'joob, goob. Jooba, jooba, jooba.

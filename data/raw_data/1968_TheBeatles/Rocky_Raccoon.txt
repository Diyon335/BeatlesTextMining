Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota, there lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon. And one day his woman ran off with another guy, hit young Rocky in the eye. Rocky didn't like that, he said, "I'm gonna get that boy." So one day he walked into town, booked himself a room in the local saloon.
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room, only to find Gideon's Bible. Rocky had come equipped with a gun to shoot off the legs of his rival. His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams by stealing the girl of his fancy. Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil, but everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan, were in the next room at the hoedown. Rocky burst in and grinning a grin, he said, "Danny, boy, this is a showdown!" But Daniel was hot, and he drew first and shot, and Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin, and proceeded to lie on the table. He said, "Rocky, you met your match." And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch, and I'll be better. I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able."
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room, only to find Gideon's Bible. A-Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt to help with good Rocky's revival. Oh yeah, yeah'n, doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo, dooo doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo, dooo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo, ndoo doo-doo-doo, dooo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo doo.

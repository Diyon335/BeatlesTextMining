You say you want a revolution, well, you know we all want to change the world. You tell me that it's evolution, well, you know we all want to change the world. But when you talk about destruction, don't you know that you can count me out-in? Don't you know it's gonna be all right? Don't you know it's gonna be all right? Don't you know it's gonna be all right?
You say you got a real solution, well, you know we'd all love to see the plan. (Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa) You ask me for a contribution, well, you know we're all doing what we can. (Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa) But if you want money for people with minds that hate, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait. Don't you know it's gonna be all right? Don't you know it's gonna be all right? Don't you know it's gonna be all right?
You say you'll change the constitution, well, you know we'd all love to change your head. (Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa) You tell me it's the institution, well, you know you'd better free your mind instead. (Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa) But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow. Don't you know it's gonna be all right? Don't you know it's gonna be all right? Don't you know it's gonna be all right?
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

John:Paul
Last night I said these words to my girl, I know you never even try, girl. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Please please me, whoa, yeah, like I please you.
You don't need me to show the way, love. Why do I always have to say "love"? Come on, come on, come on, come on. Please please me, whoa, yeah, like I please you.
I don't wanna sound complaining, but you know there's always rain in my heart. I do all the pleasing with you, it's so hard to reason with you, whoa yeah. Why do you make me blue?

Here comes the sun.
Here comes the sun.
And I say, it's all right.
Little darlin', it's been a long cold lonely winter.
Little darlin', it feels like years since it's been here.
Here comes the sun.
Here comes the sun, and I say, it's all right.
Little darlin', the smiles returning to their faces.
Little darlin', it seems like years since it's been here.
Here comes the sun.
Here comes the sun, and I say it's all right.
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes.
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes.
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes.
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes.
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes.
Little darlin', I feel that ice is slowly melting.
Little darlin', it seems like years since it's been clear.
Here comes the sun.
Here comes the sun, and I say it's all right.
Here comes the sun.
Here comes the sun.
It's all right.
It's all right.

Paul
Once there was a way, to get back homeward.
Once there was a way, to get back home.
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby.
Golden slumbers fill your eyes.
Smiles awake you when you rise.
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby.
Once there was a way to get back homeward.
Once there was a way, to get back home.
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby.

It was twenty years ago today, that Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play. They've been going in and out of style, but they're guaranteed to raise a smile. So may I introduce to you, the act you've known for all these years: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, we hope you will enjoy the show. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, sit back and let the evening go. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill. You're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us. We'd love to take you home. I don't really want to stop the show, but I thought you might like to know. That the singer's gonna sing a song, and he wants you all to sing along. So let me introduce to you, the one and only Billy Shears, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, yeah, Billy Shears.
